# Functions share Local Variable with Children

From the bash man-page:

> Variables  local  to the function may be declared with the local builtin command (local variables).  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.  If a variable is declared local, the variable's visible scope is restricted to that function and its children (including  the  functions it calls).
